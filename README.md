# Fun Super Nintendo Games!
## Here are my favorite Super Nintendo Games that I love to play!
### I love vintage games ... just an fyi. That is if you couldn't already tell.

*I have a lot of games that I really enjoy playing on my Super Nintendo, but in this project I'll just be naming a handfull of my favorites.*

<sub>Note: There are two alternating types of this particular console. There is the Japanese Super Famicom. Then there is the North American Super NES. I personally own the latter. The Japanese Super Famicom has the same design as the European Super NES as well. NES stands for Nintendo Entertainment System.</sub>

**As you can tell, I am unhealthily passionate about this console.**

[Anyways, here is a Wikipedia link containg all of that info. and more: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System)]

**Basic Java Example Code:**

class HelloWorld {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}
